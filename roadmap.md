# Feature Roadmap

### Todo

- Highlight node when cursor hovers within node boundaries (so much harder than I thought it would be)
- Side panel populates when user selects node
- Generate list of node names
- Apply list of names to nodes (Appears in side panel when user selects a node)
- Limit node progression based on surrounding nodes
- Allow sieges to destroy nodes
- Implement ZOI
- Implement node types (religious, economic, militaristic, etc)
- Add in Castle nodes
- Assign resources to nodes
- Allow user to move node boundaries
- Allow user to save and load different node boundaries


### Completed
- ~~Create SQLite DB~~
- ~~Create DB table for nodes~~
- ~~Create GUI for simulation~~
- ~~Create "start simulation" GUI button~~
- ~~Create "pause simulation" GUI button~~
