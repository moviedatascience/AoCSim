# Feature Roadmap

### Todo

- Left side panel populates when user selects node

- Configure paths to pull from a config file instead of the script 
- Implement ZOI

- Add in Castle nodes
- Assign resources to nodes
- Allow GUI user to move node boundaries
- Allow GUI user to save and load different node boundaries
- Add housing to nodes

### Completed
- ~~Create SQLite DB~~
- ~~Create DB table for nodes~~
- ~~Create GUI for simulation~~
- ~~Create "start simulation" GUI button~~
